Hacking wireless networks involves exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless communication protocols, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee.

This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.

Wireless networks are often less secure than wired networks, making them a common target for attackers.
