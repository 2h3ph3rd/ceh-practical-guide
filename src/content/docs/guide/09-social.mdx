Social engineering is the art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.

It relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical hacking techniques to gain access to systems, networks, or physical locations.

A common technique is phishing, where attackers send fraudulent emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
