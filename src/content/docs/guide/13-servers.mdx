Hacking web servers involves exploiting vulnerabilities in web server software, misconfigurations, and insecure coding practices to gain unauthorized access or control over the server. This can lead to data breaches, defacement, or the installation of malicious software.

Web servers are the backbone of the internet, serving content to users and handling requests.

Understanding how to secure and attack web servers is crucial for both defenders and attackers.

## Footprinting

Web server footprinting is the process of gathering information about a web server to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

There are several tools for automating scanning and fingerprinting web servers.

Also nmap can be used for obtaining information about a web server.

```sh
nmap -sV --script http-enum TARGET
```
