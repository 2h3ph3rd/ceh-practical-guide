Hacking web applications involves exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication mechanisms. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.

Web applications are the most common target for attackers, as they often handle sensitive data and are accessible over the internet.

## Footprinting

Web application footprinting is the process of gathering information about a web application to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

There are several tools and techniques for automating scanning and fingerprinting web applications:

- nmap can be used to obtain additional information about a target.
- ZAP provides a powerful scanner to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.

```sh
# Use nmap to enumerate services and versions
nmap -sV -p 80 --script http-enum TARGET

# Enumerate files and directories
gobuster dir -u http://TARGET -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

## Common vulnerabilities

There are several vulnerabilities that can be exploited in web applications based on the architecture and technology used.

### SQL Injection

SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a vulnerability in an application's software by manipulating SQL queries. This can allow attackers to view, modify, or delete data in the database.

```txt
' OR 1=1 --
```

### XSS

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

```html
<script>
  alert("XSS");
</script>
```

### CSRF

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks the user into executing unwanted actions on a different site where they are authenticated.
This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user, such as changing account settings or making purchases.

```html
<form action="http://example.com/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000" />
  <input type="submit" value="Transfer Money" />
</form>
```

### RCE

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote server or system.

This can lead to complete control over the target system and access to sensitive data.

```sh
curl -X POST -d "cmd=whoami" http://example.com/execute
```

### LFI

Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to include files on a server through the web browser.
This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files and information.

```sh
curl -X GET "http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd"
curl -X GET "http://example.com/index.php?page=%2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2Fetc%2Fpasswd"
```
