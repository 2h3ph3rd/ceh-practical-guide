IoT (Internet of Things) and OT (Operational Technology) hacking involves exploiting vulnerabilities in connected devices and systems that control physical processes. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.

IoT and OT systems can be accessible over the internet, making them a common target for attackers.

These systems often have limited security measures, making them vulnerable to exploitation.
