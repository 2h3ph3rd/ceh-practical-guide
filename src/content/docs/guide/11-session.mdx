Session hijacking is a type of attack where an attacker takes control of a user's session after the user has authenticated.

This can be done by stealing session cookies, tokens, or other session identifiers.

## Proxies

Proxies can be used to intercept and modify network traffic, allowing attackers to hijack sessions.

Common proxies are Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP.

## MITM

Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks involve intercepting and altering communication between two parties without their knowledge.

This can be done using various techniques, such as ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, or SSL stripping.
