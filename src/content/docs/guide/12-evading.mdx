Evasion techniques are methods used to bypass security measures such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), firewalls, and honeypots.

These techniques are often employed by attackers to avoid detection and maintain access to compromised systems.

## Intrusion Detection Systems

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are security tools that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats.

## Honeypots

Honeypots are decoy systems or services designed to attract and analyze attackers.

They are used to gather intelligence on attack methods and techniques, as well as to distract attackers from real targets.
