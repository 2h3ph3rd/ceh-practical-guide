Sniffing is a technique used to monitor network traffic and gather information about the data being transmitted.

It can be used for various purposes, including network analysis, troubleshooting, and security assessments.

## Active sniffing

Active sniffing is done by sending packets to the network to elicit responses from devices.

This can help identify devices, protocols, and services running on the network.

## Passive sniffing

Passive sniffing is done by monitoring network traffic without actively sending packets.

This can be done using network taps, port mirroring, or by using a network interface in promiscuous mode.

### Wireshark

Wireshark is a popular tool for passive sniffing and can capture and analyze network traffic.

```
tcp.port eq 25 or icmp

tcp.window_size == 0 && tcp.flags.reset != 1

http.request.uri matches "gl=se$"

udp contains 81:60:03
```

## Sniffing detection

Sniffing can be detected by monitoring network traffic for unusual patterns or by using intrusion detection systems (IDS).
