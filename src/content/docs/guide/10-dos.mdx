Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are a type of attack that aims to make a system or service unavailable to its intended users.

This is typically achieved by overwhelming the target with a flood of illegitimate requests, causing it to slow down or crash.

When multiple systems are used to perform a DoS attack, it is usually referred to as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
