The first step in the penetration testing process is footprinting and reconnaissance.

This phase involves gathering as much information as possible about the target system or network to identify potential vulnerabilities.

Information gathering can be done through various methods, including:

- **Passive Footprinting**: Collecting information without directly interacting with the target system.
- **Active Footprinting**: Actively probing the target system to gather information.

## Footprinting with search engines

### Google hacking

Google hacking techniques are advanced search techniques that can be used to find specific information on the internet.

### Image search engines

Image search engines can be used to find images related to a specific topic or similar to a given image.

Images can contain metadata that can be useful for footprinting.

### Video search engines

Video search engines can be used to find videos related to a specific topic or keyword.

Videos like images can contain metadata that can be useful for footprinting.

### FTP search engines

FTP search engines can be used to find files and directories on FTP servers.

Like web pages also FTP servers can be indexed by search engines.

### IoT search engines

IoT search engines can be used to find Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to the internet.

These search engines can be used to find devices like webcams, routers, and other IoT devices.

### Dark and deep web searching

The deep web refers to parts of the internet that are not indexed by traditional search engines.

The dark web is a small part of the deep web that is intentionally hidden and inaccessible through standard web browsers.

The dark web is often associated with illegal activities, but it can also be used for legitimate purposes.

## Footprinting for web servers

### Ping

It is possible to gather information about a target website using the ping command line utility.

Information such as the IP address, hostname, and response time can be obtained.

```bash
ping TARGET
```

## DNS and Whois footprinting

Whois is a protocol used to query databases that store registered users or assignees of a domain name or an IP address block.

Whois databases are maintained by various organizations, including domain registrars and regional internet registries (RIRs).

DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical naming system used to translate domain names into IP addresses.

### nslookup

nslookup is a command-line tool used to query DNS servers for information about domain names and IP addresses.

nslookup can be used to gather information about a target's DNS records, including A records, MX records, and NS records.

```bash
nslookup TARGET
```

## Network footprinting

Network footprinting is the process of gathering information about a target network, including IP addresses, subnets, and network devices.
