Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and information from adversaries.

It involves the use of mathematical algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

Cryptography is essential for protecting sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data, from unauthorized access and tampering.

It is widely used in various applications, including secure communication, digital signatures, and secure storage.

## Hashing Algorithms

Hashing algorithms are cryptographic functions that convert data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash value.

Hashing is a one-way process, meaning that it is not possible to reverse the hash value back to the original data.

Hashing is commonly used for data integrity checks, password storage, and digital signatures.

```bash
# Hash a file using SHA-256
sha256sum file.txt

# Hash a password using bcrypt
echo -n "password" | bcrypt

# Identify hashing algorithm used
hashid -m hash_value

# Crack a hash using wordlist
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash_value wordlist.txt
```

## Email encryption

Email encryption is the process of encrypting email messages to protect their content from unauthorized access.

It ensures that only the intended recipient can read the message, even if it is intercepted during transmission.

Email encryption can be achieved using various methods, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

## Disk encryption

Disk encryption is the process of encrypting the entire contents of a disk or storage device to protect data from unauthorized access.

It ensures that data is unreadable without the correct decryption key, even if the device is lost or stolen.

## Cryptanalysis

Cryptanalysis is the study of analyzing and breaking cryptographic systems to uncover hidden information.

It involves the use of mathematical techniques and algorithms to find weaknesses in cryptographic systems and exploit them.

Cryptanalysis is an essential part of cryptography, as it helps identify vulnerabilities and improve the security of cryptographic systems.
