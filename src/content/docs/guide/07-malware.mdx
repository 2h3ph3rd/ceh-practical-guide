## Viruses

A virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to a legitimate program or file and spreads to other programs and files when the infected program is executed.

JPS Virus Maker Tool is a tool that can be used to create viruses.

## Static Malware Analysis

Static malware analysis is the process of analyzing malware without executing it.

It involves examining the code, structure, and behavior of the malware to understand its functionality and potential impact.

### Online tools

There are several online tools that can be used for static malware analysis.

These tools can help you analyze a malware sample by uploading it to their platform or by giving a hash of the file.

### Disassemblers and debuggers

Disassemblers are tools that convert machine code into assembly language, allowing you to analyze the code of a malware sample.

Disassemblers can help you understand the functionality of the malware and identify any malicious behavior.
