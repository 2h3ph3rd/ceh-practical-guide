Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, allowing users to access and use resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics without the need for on-premises infrastructure.

Because cloud computing services are still based on physical hardware, they are vulnerable to the same types of attacks as traditional computing environments. This includes attacks on the underlying infrastructure, such as servers and storage devices, as well as attacks on the applications and data stored in the cloud.

## S3 Bucket Enumeration

S3 buckets are a popular storage solution provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

They are often used to store and share data, making them a common target for attackers.

S3 bucket enumeration is the process of discovering and accessing S3 buckets that may contain sensitive data or misconfigured permissions.

## AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for managing AWS services from the command line.

It allows users to automate tasks, manage resources, and perform various operations on AWS services.

```bash
# Configure a new AWS CLI profile
aws configure --profile PROFILE_NAME

# List all S3 buckets
aws s3 ls

# List all objects in a specific S3 bucket
aws s3 ls s3://BUCKET_NAME

# Download a file from an S3 bucket
aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET_NAME/FILE_NAME .

# Get secret keys from AWS CLI
aws configure list

# Get available secrets
aws secretsmanager list-secrets

# Get secret value
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id SECRET_ID

# Get IAM user information
aws iam list-users
aws iam get-user
aws iam list-access-keys
aws iam get-access-key-last-used --access-key-id ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws iam list-groups
```
